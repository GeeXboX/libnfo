NFO files are used to store metadata information on many multimedia files.
It is used by both Enna and XBMC Media Center.
See http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=Import_-_Export_Library

Try ./configure --help for list of available build options.

ALWAYS consider nfo.h as the ONLY public header.
Check your code for warnings before commits.

Versioning policy
--
The major version means no backward compatibility to previous versions (e.g.
removal of a function from the public API). The minor version means backward
compatible change (e.g. addition of a function to the public API or extension
of an existing data structure). The micro version means a noteworthy binary
compatible change (e.g. internal changes).
